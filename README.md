The program is free to use and trade because it is extremely simple, the only question I do if they are going to publicize or commercialize it for reference >> "Developed by John Heberty de Freitas, Federal University of Goi√°s, of the Transport Engineering course, in Brazil." <<. I am new in this area and I am building my resume, I ask you to help me spreading my instagram page >> ToPraSerEng. Thank you all, have fun!
